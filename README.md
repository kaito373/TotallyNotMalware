# Totally Not Malware

If you didn't undertand, it's OBVIOUSLY not a real app.
It's just for fun. Source is available, you can check if you don't trust me.

The tool will play an integrated music file in the background.
All resources (ico, wav, gif) are in the Resources folder if you need any of them.

Don't forget, it's an useless app just for fun, but it's also my first try at C#.
So my code might be crap, in that case, just please forgive me xD
Coded in C# with .NET Framework 4.6.1.
